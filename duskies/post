Here is an example of the deltas I see in block-to-block values.  This is an **alpha** result:
```{
  "dusk_provisioning_delta_summary": {
    "timestamp_sec": 10,
    "dusk_chain_block_index": 1,
    "dusk_chain_epochblock_index": 1,
    "dusk_development_fund_reward_dusk": 1.98574,
    "dusk_provisioners_reward_dusk": 15.234348998
  }
}```
This is typical of what I'm seeing.  I'm puzzled because the provisioner rewards per block is smaller than I was expecting given the tokenomics...
